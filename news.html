      <h2>Bitcoin Surpasses $75K Amid Institutional Inflows</h2>
      <div class="meta">May 13, 2025 • By Sarah Blockchain</div>
      <p class="lead">
        After months of sideways movement, Bitcoin has finally broken the $75,000 barrier, signaling renewed confidence among institutional investors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bitcoin rallied 8.2% over the past 48 hours, driven largely by capital inflows from newly approved ETFs and increased demand from Asia. Analysts attribute this surge to a combination of macroeconomic easing, the weakening dollar, and regulatory clarity from the SEC regarding crypto funds.
      </p>
      <h3>Why the Momentum Might Continue</h3>
      <p>
        According to data from Glassnode, long-term holders are accumulating again. The recent uptick in wallet activity suggests that both retail and institutions are preparing for a larger bull run. Additionally, BlackRock's updated ETF application, now including staking derivatives, has excited the market.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many experts believe this run could reach new all-time highs by Q3. However, volatility remains high and investors are advised to remain cautious in the face of ongoing macro uncertainty.

      <h2>Ethereum Fees Drop to $0.03 After Dencun Upgrade</h2>
      <div class="meta">May 12, 2025 • By Mark DeFi</div>
      <p class="lead">
        The long-awaited Dencun hard fork is live — and it's already delivering results. Ethereum gas fees are down over 90% across most L2s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Layer 2s like Optimism, Base, and zkSync have all reported record transaction volumes following the upgrade. “Blob” transactions (EIP-4844) are now standard, allowing cheaper data posting on-chain while retaining Ethereum’s security guarantees.
      </p>
      <h3>What This Means for the Ethereum Ecosystem</h3>
      <p>
        Lower fees drastically improve user experience and dApp viability. Combined with increased throughput and faster finality, Dencun may serve as the catalyst for mass Layer 2 adoption. Developers are already migrating legacy apps to blob-compatible rollups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, Vitalik Buterin emphasized that this is just the beginning of Ethereum’s roadmap toward scalability — the next step: "The Verge."
